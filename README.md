# ETH-SAMBA-24

Our project provides the authentication of documents as a service. We build this project aiming to reduce the friction to the user. To do so, we implement 3 APIs. Two are responsable to compile and deploy the contracts at Scroll. The last one focus on provinding the IPFSRegistry of both the metadata and document ( pdf file). All these is gathered at our frontend build with next.

## Folder structure

- `/compilaApi`

This file contains the smart contract and return its ABI and Binary

- `/deployApi`

This file contains the binary and deploy the contract on SepoliaScroll
The `.env` defines `API_HTTPS=https://scroll-sepolia.public.blastapi.io`

- `/getContractDataAPI`

This file contains the deploy of our IPFSRegistry.sol at scroll.io and also gives a API to add or remove CIDs at our contract.

- `/de-registry-front-test`

This file contains our frontend and connect all the previous APIs.
The website is live on [https://de-registry-test.vercel.app/](https://de-registry-test.vercel.app/)
